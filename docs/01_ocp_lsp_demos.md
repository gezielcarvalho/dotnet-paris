### **How this relates to the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: 

#### **OCP Recap**:
The **Open/Closed Principle** states that:
> **Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**

In the context of the feature additions, here’s how we can prove compliance:

1. **Adding New Features Without Modifying Core Code**:
   - We introduced **new functionality** to the `ProductService` and `ProductController` to retrieve all `PublicProduct` and `PrivateProduct` instances, but **did not modify** any existing functionality for handling `Product` (or its subclasses).
   - We added new methods to the service (`GetAllPublicProductsAsync` and `GetAllPrivateProductsAsync`) and new endpoints to the controller (`/public` and `/private`), but **the core logic of handling `Product` was left unchanged**.
   
2. **Extending Functionality, Not Modifying It**:
   - By adding these new methods and endpoints, we've extended the service and controller without having to change how the rest of the code operates. The existing methods (like `GetOneProductAsync`, `CreateProduct`, `UpdateProduct`, etc.) remain untouched and continue to support the **general `Product` class and its subclasses**.
   - This is the essence of OCP—**we are extending functionality** (retrieving all public/private products) while the original service and controller remain closed to modification.

#### **In summary for OCP**:
- **New functionality was added** for filtering products based on their type (`PublicProduct`, `PrivateProduct`) **without modifying existing code**.
- This is a perfect example of how the system is **open for extension** but **closed for modification**, complying with the **Open/Closed Principle**.

### **How this relates to the **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: 

#### **LSP Recap**:
The **Liskov Substitution Principle** states that:
> **Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.**

In the context of your application, here’s how the additions conform to LSP:

1. **Substituting `PublicProduct` and `PrivateProduct`**:
   - We’re **substituting `PublicProduct` and `PrivateProduct` for `Product`** throughout the `ProductService` and `ProductController` without causing any issues or modifying the behavior.
   - The new endpoints (`/public` and `/private`) work seamlessly with the base class `Product` but specifically return either **`PublicProduct`** or **`PrivateProduct`**. The behavior is consistent, and the new feature does **not break the existing contract** of `Product`.

2. **Correctness and Substitution**:
   - The **substitution** of `PublicProduct` and `PrivateProduct` for `Product` does not introduce errors. In fact, the code simply **filters the `Product` collection** based on the type, which is perfectly in line with the **Liskov Substitution Principle**. 
   - The `ProductService` and `ProductController` continue to function as expected for all `Product`-based objects, whether they are `PublicProduct` or `PrivateProduct`, demonstrating that subclasses can be substituted **without affecting correctness**.

3. **Consistency Across Methods**:
   - The new methods (`GetAllPublicProductsAsync` and `GetAllPrivateProductsAsync`) filter the product list based on type, but **they maintain the expected behavior** for all `Product`-derived types. This ensures that the **correctness of the program** is upheld when switching between different `Product` subclasses, which is a hallmark of LSP compliance.

#### **In summary for LSP**:
- **Substituting instances of `PublicProduct` or `PrivateProduct` for `Product`** in the `ProductService` and `ProductController` works **without affecting the correctness of the program**.
- The system demonstrates **polymorphism** and **substitution** of subclasses in a way that adheres to **Liskov Substitution Principle**.

### **Summary of LSP and OCP Compliance in the New Features**:

| **Principle**  | **How the New Feature Demonstrates Compliance**  |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **OCP (Open/Closed Principle)** | New features (e.g., filtering products by type) were **added** without changing existing methods and functionality in the service or controller. This extends the behavior of the application without modifying existing code. |
| **LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)** | The new features **substitute `PublicProduct` and `PrivateProduct`** for `Product` without affecting the correctness of the program. The filtering of `Product` types works as expected, adhering to polymorphism. |

---

### **Final Thoughts**:
- **OCP** is demonstrated by the ability to **add new functionality** (retrieving public/private products) without modifying existing code.
- **LSP** is demonstrated by the fact that we can **substitute** `PublicProduct` and `PrivateProduct` wherever `Product` is expected, and the behavior remains correct and predictable.

These features confirm that the system is designed to be **open for extension** and **closed for modification** (OCP) and that **substitution of `Product`-derived types** works correctly (LSP).
